Welcome, thrill-seeking gambler! Are you ready for a game of BlackJack like no other? Get ready to face the ultimate challenge and test your luck against the Devil himself! This is not just a game, its a chance to earn your place in heaven.

You already know the basics - get as close to 21 without busting. But this time, there's a twist: you're playing against the Devil, and you need to beat him by depleting his bank before he takes all of yours. Can you outsmart the Prince of Darkness and come out on top?

Don't expect any easy outs, though. There will be no side bets, insurance or splitting - this game is all about pure skill and cunning.  But fear not, there will be some surprising quirks along the way that will keep you on your toes.

You'll start with a respectable 20,000 Obol, but the Devil has a whopping 80,000 Obol to his name. Obol, you ask? According to Greek mythology, this was the coin needed for safe passage into the underworld. So you better guard your stash carefully!

But wait, there's more! If you run out of Obol, don't despair just yet. You'll get a second chance to redeem yourself, but this time you'll need to sell off your assets for Obol. You only get one shot at this, so use it wisely. And if you somehow still manage to lose (yikes!), the Devil will claim your soul for eternity.

So go ahead, give it your best shot. Just remember to play responsibly and keep your eyes on the prize. And one last thing - everything in this game is fictional, except for your soul. So if you lose it, there are no refunds. Good luck!
