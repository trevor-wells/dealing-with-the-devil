## Project Requirements

Greetings gambling addict, this is not your average game of BlackJack, this is something more serious. Today you will have a chance to deal with the Devil and possibly have a chance to go to heaven! Consider this as an expansion pack on your regular BlackJack game. The rules are the following:

- Most of the rules in BlackJack apply, get as close to 21 without going over (busting)

- You will be playing against the Devil to deplete his bank without losing all of yours first. If you are able to make his bank === 0 you will be able to make it to heaven.

- There will be no side bets, insurance or splitting, unfortunately the creators of this glorious game did not have the facilities to implement these aspects. Nevertheless, there will be quirks that have never seen before in a game of 21.

- You will start off with 20,000 Obol and the Devil will have 80,000 obol

 (According to Greek mythology, to be properly buried, a coin called an obol needed to be placed under your tongue. This would then be presented to Charon (the ferryman of the River Styx), as payment for the crossing of the river. The entrance to Hades, the underworld, was on the other side of the river. )

- There will be a second chance to redeem yourself once you hit 0 for the first time. Once you are all out of obol, it will return you to the title screen and there will be an option to sell assets for obol to continue playing. You will only be able to your sell assets once. If you still somehow manage to lose (lol) then the Devil wins and takes over your soul. 

- Good luck and please play responsibly

- Developer Notes: Everything in this game is completely fictional with the exception of your soul, if you happen to lose your soul along the path of this game, there will be at no point for a refund.
