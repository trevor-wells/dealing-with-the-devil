## Project Requirements

 - Use github and push frequently
  
 - Use one more 1 distinct event listener 
  ```
  - search or filter functionality
  - toggling dark/light mode
  - upvoting posts
  ```
  
 - Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

 - Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
